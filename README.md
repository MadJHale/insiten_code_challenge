# Insiten Coding Challenge

### Business Problem:
A company is looking to achieve inorganic growth through acquisitions. They have asked us to develop
an online tool to track and analyze potential target companies.
### Challenge:
Develop a prototype that will allow the client to perform the following activities:
* View a list of targets
* Edit an existing target
* Create a new target
* Delete a target
### Assumptions:
* Use a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Angular)
* Data does not need to be persisted (use mock data)
* Examples of data to be captured:
  * Status (e.g., researching, pending approval, approved, declined)
  * Company Info
  * Key Contacts
  * Financial Performance
